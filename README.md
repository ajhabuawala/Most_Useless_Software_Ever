## Inspiration
The theme of hacklarious was to build something silly while trying to learn something new. Taking inspiration from one of the silliest hardware projects:

We decided to build something similar but just in software 

## What it does
Just a simple website that has a large button and when a user clicks the button the server hosting the website is killed and a message is relayed to the user "I was killed, please restart" in a funny way. 

## How we built it
Python + Flask + SocketIO for the backend 
Javascript + jQuery + HTML for the frontend
